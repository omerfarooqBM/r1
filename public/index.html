      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1>library vs Framework</h1>
    <p>
          library vs Framework are reusable pre written code by someone else that is used to solve common problems if u are using an library u are incharege u can call any it any time and use it as u see fit . <br>
if ur are using a framework , framwork is incharge and u have to follow through every rule and path pre defined in it u can build a complete application in a framework with backend . if u are using libraries u have to use multiple of them to build a complete application
        </p>
    <h1>Dom vs Virtual dom</h1>
    <p>
      <p>
        <strong>DOM</strong> is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML it contains all the properties methods andevents of html elements. HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.if u make achange in ur html u have to refresh ur page to see the change. <br> <strong>The virtual DOM (VDOM)</strong> is a programming concept where an ideal or virtual representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM. it only changes the component which is changed or altered without reloading or refreshing whole application
      </p>
    
    <h1>Oneway Data Binding vs Two way</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>One-way data binding</strong><br>
One-way data-binding means the data flows in a single direction so that whenever the data changes in a component, it also updates the view with new data.
<br>
<strong>Two-way data binding</strong><br>
Two-way data binding means data flows in both directions, it means any change happens in the view updates the data and any change happens in the data updates the view.

    </p>
    <h1>React vs Angular</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>angular</strong> is a complete framework for development of dynamic and complete web apps with backend where as <strong>react</strong> is a javascript library use to build ui designs for a complete webb ap or any other app development in react we have to attack back-end to it angular is based on modal view controller where as react is is based on virtual dom. react is baised on javascript and angular is baised on typescript
    </p>
    <h1>spa vs mpa</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>SPA</strong>  : stands for single page application . SP Applications are faster because The page doesn’t reload entirely whenever the user requests a new piece of data. SPA frontend and backend are sperate .SPA s falls behind in SCO optimization compaired to MPAs
<br><strong>MPA</strong>: stands for multipage application nar emore staple applications but they are slower then SP Applications because it must reload the page from scratch when ever u want to go to another page or get new data MPA’s, front-end and back-end are more interdependent. All coding is usually under one project.MPA s gets higher ranking on google seo
